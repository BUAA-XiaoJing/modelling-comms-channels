**Modelling Wireless Communication Channels** - Oxford 3rd year coursework project

**Project description**
This project involved representing data in the absence of a physics-based model, but using parametrised functions. It aimed to mathematically model a phenomenon completely ignoring its underlying physical model.

I investigated the statistical properties of electromagnetic communication signals, more specifically in relation to Wi-Fi systems operating within an indoor environment. I did this by constructing a mathematical model of the probability density function describing the attenuation caused by the scattering process in the wireless communication medium. 

My model was based on real measured data acquired by members of the Oxford Communications Research Group. To fit the data you I used a set of orthogonal basis functions called Laguerre functions. The first part of the project dealt with understanding the function orthogonality and deriving the Laguerre functions.
